# -Stock-Market-Analysis-Forecasting-Model

This project is a comprehensive Python-based tool for analyzing, forecasting, and assessing risk in stock markets. It integrates financial data acquisition, technical indicators, ARIMA time series forecasting, and Monte Carlo simulations.
This project is a comprehensive Python-based stock market analysis and forecasting model. It utilizes historical data to perform descriptive and diagnostic analysis (utilizing technical indicators such as SMA, RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands), predictive analysis (employing ARIMA for forecasting), and Monte Carlo simulations for risk assessment. 
The model provides a clear investment recommendation and visualizes all key findings.

The project demonstrates knowledge in:
1. Financial Data Analysis: Handling stock data, calculating returns, and key statistics.
2. Technical Analysis: Applying common indicators to understand market trends.
3. Time Series Forecasting: Using ARIMA models for future price prediction.
4. Statistical Modeling & Simulation: Implementing Monte Carlo simulations for probabilistic forecasting and risk assessment (VaR, Expected Shortfall, Sharpe Ratio).
5. Data Visualization: Presenting complex data and insights interactively using Plotly.
6. Python Programming: Proficiency with libraries like yfinance, pandas, numpy, plotly, statsmodels, pmdarima, and scipy.
7. Skills: Python for Data Analysis · Predictive Analytics · Descriptive Analysis · Prescriptive Analytics · Statistical Data 8. Analysis · Forecasting · Time Series Analysis · Statistical Modeling · Data Visualization · Monte Carlo Simulation
